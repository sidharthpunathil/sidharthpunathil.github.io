everything started with an experiment, i was 15.

back then, i was all-in on video games.
from prince of persia (that dahaka chase was unreal) to grand theft auto (CJ on the roll of a lifetime), all i had time for was playing games. nothing else mattered.

i never owned a game boy (the dream), but i had something better:
an emulator on my pc and an insatiable curiosity.
pokémon red, blue, firered, ruby, diamond, perl i played them all

so ended up wanting to learn reverse engineering just so i could crack any game i wanted.
x64dbg and decompilers became my playground.
the day i successfully cracked winrar? pure euphoria.
while today's kids that age are building million-dollar startups from their bedrooms,
i was playing with 1's, 0's, and a couple of dots, trying to outsmart systems that weren't meant to be outsmarted.

## the stupid and foolish days

somewhere around that time, i discovered link-shortening platforms.
the concept was simple: convert traffic into ad views, ad views into money.
i started posting random videos on youtube—game tutorials, crack guides, whatever worked—
and funneling viewers through my shortened links on linkshrink.

the system had rules. i used proxies to bypass them.
high-quality proxies worked better, but my accounts usually got banned anyway.
i'd browse hacker forums late into the night, hunting for new proxy tools.
to me, this was the infinite money glitch.

but there was one problem: i was 15. no bank account meant no withdrawals.

linkshrink—with its dark green logo that i can still picture eventually sent me an email years later.
we're shutting down. withdraw your amount now.
i had around ~$20 waiting, but i had no option, still had no bank account.
by the time i came of age, the platform was gone.

twenty dollars. my first internet money. gone.

## the e-commerce detour

around the same time, i discovered a platform called wooplr
where you could create your own affiliate store for free.
just add products from other stores with your markup. simple.

marketing, however, was not simple.
i didn't know anything about it, so i did what any resourceful teenager would do: i went down a rabbit hole of youtube videos trying to learn "marketing."
somewhere in that mess, i stumbled onto this absurd idea of selling products by texting random strangers in chat rooms and casually dropping my store link.

wooplr eventually shut down too.

## getting legitimate

high school brought my first real wins.
i got myself a minor pan card (since i wasn't 18 yet) and opened a bank account near my school.
with an actual bank account now backing me, i went all-in on amazon affiliate marketing.
being the tech guy in my circle paid off—i referred all my friends to gaming laptops.
back then, the commissions were generous: ~$50 per affiliate sale.

i also discovered crypto around this time.
i tried mining on my potato pc (sadly, i didn't save my dogecoin private keys).
between affiliate marketing and crypto experiments, i was doing every small gig i could find—
including falling for multi-level marketing scams that promised the world and delivered nothing.

## the hacker phase

my interest shifted to cybersecurity.
i joined a hacker academy despite my parents' concerns that "hacking was bad for kids."
i insisted this was what i wanted to become.

i started as a script kiddie, but i grew from there.
i taught myself python, i remember building instagram bots that used to get me followers on my side quest experiments, wrote my own tools,
spent way too much time inside hacker forums, discovering tools, tactics, and little pieces of internet gold—
and yes, trying to brute-force the student login portal was a thing of the past.
it was all part-time fun, but it taught me how systems actually worked—and how they broke.

## the turning point

at 18, i joined college and rediscovered crypto with fresh eyes.
i got more serious in coding and programming, more entrepreneurial.
i started a club in college where we went for hackathons and built products together.

then i won my first hackathon.

that was the lightbulb moment. hackathons became my nobrainer.
in course of time, we won more than 15 hackathons.
each one taught me something new: how to build fast, how to pitch better,
how to work with strangers and ship products in 48 hours.

then covid hit.

while the world locked down, i had time to learn from home.
that was peak web3: airdrops, grants, trading, projects appearing overnight.
it felt like discovering "internet black box money"—meme coins, yield farming,
protocols that didn't exist six months prior.

there was this time i found a loophole in brave browser's bat (basic attention token) distribution
and discovered a way to get more than intended.
i built a tool to automate the whole flow.
didn't go super black hat, but that was definitely a gray hat thing i did.
i probably made a couple thousand dollars during that period,
though honestly, the learning was more cool than the money.

## today

i skipped campus placement offers.
instead, started cofount.com with my friends adithya & rajat.

there's still a lot more to earn and grow.
but looking back at that $20 i never was able to withdrew
the journey from there to here taught me something more valuable than any earnings

the internet rewards curiosity, persistence, and the willingness to try things that might not work.
sometimes they don't. sometimes the platform shuts down before you can cash out. ofcourse :)

but sometimes, you build something that matters.
and that makes all the failed experiments worth it.
and you go all in.
