the screen was bright enough to light half the room. it was 2am, maybe 3. i was 15, glued to x64dbg, staring at a wall of hex values i barely understood. somewhere in that mess of bytes was the thing that made winrar ask you to pay. i just had to find it.

i'd been at this for days. not because anyone told me to. not for school, not for a grade. i wanted to crack winrar because i wanted to know if i *could*.

the moment it worked — when the nag screen just... didn't appear — i didn't move. i sat there, staring at the screen, waiting for it to come back. it didn't. i closed the program. opened it again. nothing. the satisfaction was unreal. i didn't tell anyone. all my victories were private.

it reinforced something i was starting to believe — you can get whatever you want if you're stubborn enough to bend it your way.

## how it started

i never owned a game boy. that was the dream, but we didn't have that kind of money for toys. what i did have was a beat-up pc and an emulator i found from the internet.

pokémon red, blue, ruby, firered, diamond. played every single one on that emulator.

but i wasn't just playing the games. i was pulling them apart. i wanted to know why things worked. how a game stored your save data, how a cheat code actually changed memory values, how someone could build an entire world inside a machine.

prince of persia, grand theft auto, claw — i wasn't just a kid playing games. i was a kid who couldn't stop asking *how*.

that curiosity is what eventually led me to reverse engineering. how to break the system.

## the $ i never got

somewhere around that time, i discovered link-shortening platforms. the idea was simple: you wrap a link in ads, share it everywhere, and get paid per click. linkshrink. dark green logo. i can still picture it.

i started posting game tutorials on youtube — how to crack this, how to mod that — and every link in the description went through linkshrink. i'd check my dashboard obsessively. $0.30. $0.87. $1.14. watching those numbers tick up felt like discovering a cheat code for real life.

then i found out about proxies.

if you could fake traffic from high-value countries, the payout per click went up. so i did. i'd browse hacker forums at 2am, hunting for proxy lists, rotating IPs, trying to stay one step ahead of the ban hammer. most of my accounts got nuked. i'd just make new ones.

to a 15-year-old, this was the infinite money glitch. i was going to be rich.

except for one problem: i didn't have a bank account. i was fifteen. you can't withdraw money from the internet if you don't have a place to put it. so i watched my balance climb and figured i'd cash out eventually. no rush.

years later, an email showed up. linkshrink was shutting down. withdraw your balance now.

i still didn't have a bank account.

by the time i finally opened one, the platform was gone. the website, the dashboard, the dark green logo — all of it. my first internet money. vanished before i ever touched it.

## breaking things to understand them

after that, something shifted. i stopped trying to make money from the internet and started trying to understand it. i picked up python, and automating things felt like magic — writing a few lines and watching the computer do your work for you.

i joined a hacker academy. my parents thought "hacking" meant i was going to end up in jail. i told them this was what i wanted to do with my life. they weren't convinced, but they let me go.

i started where everyone starts — as a script kiddie, running tools i didn't fully understand against targets i probably shouldn't have been touching. but i kept going. i taught myself python. built instagram bots that actually worked. wrote my own tools from scratch.

i spent nights inside forums where people shared things you couldn't find on google. not because it was secret, but because no one outside those circles cared enough to look.

my username on cracked.to was borrowed from a video game character. it started gaining traction after i shared something the forum considered high value. the platform gave me a rank — suddenly i had access to every resource on there. i'd lurk like a ghost, never reacting, never interacting, just quietly taking what i needed. that was a crazy feeling.

i built a brute-force system to pull details of my friend's crush from the school portal. according to him, it was the most useful program i ever wrote.

every system i broke taught me how to build a better one.

## the moment it clicked

at 18, i walked into my first hackathon not knowing what to expect. forty-eight hours later, we won.

i remember the exact feeling — not the prize, not the announcement — but the moment during the build when everything was falling into place. the code was working, the pitch was sharp, and for the first time, the thing i'd been doing alone in my room for years suddenly mattered to other people. this was before ai could do it all for you — every line was ours, and all those late nights were finally paying off.

after that, we couldn't stop. our team started to attend more, and we kept winning.

each one compressed months of learning into a single weekend. how to ship fast. how to pitch under pressure. how to build with strangers and trust the process.

then covid locked the world down, and i had nothing but time.

i was shifting my focus to bitcoin and blockchains — the concept fascinated me. airdrops, grants, meme coins, yield farming — protocols appearing overnight and disappearing just as fast. i remember finding a loophole in brave browser's token distribution and built a tool to automate it. it wasn't a critical issue — just something you could automate at scale. i never shared it online. but me and my friends made a couple thousand dollars and learned more about gaming the game — which was what always gave me a kick.

## the bet

when campus placements came around, i got a couple of offers but was never actively invested in the job search.

whenever i was back in my hometown, i'd catch up with adithya and rajat — the boys from high school. one of those catchups turned into [cofount](https://cofount.com).

no safety net. no backup plan. just three people who'd rather build something of their own than collect a salary building someone else's dream.

if there's one thing all of this taught me — you can make something from nothing on the internet, if you're willing to sit in front of a screen long enough to figure out how.

i'm still sitting here.
