— everything started with an experiement. <br>

I was 15 back then, all in on video games. <br>
downloading, cracking, and playing pirated video games gave me the kick. <br>
pokémon red, blue, firered, ruby, emerald — i've played them all. <br>
didn’t have a game boy, though owning one was a dream, but had an emulator on my pc. <br>
wanted to learn reverse engineering just so that i could crack any game i want.<br>
x64dbg and decompiler was my play tool, cracking winrar was my happiest moment. <br>
nowadays, kids that age are building million-dollar startups from their bedrooms. <br>

somewhere around that time, i discovered link-shortening websites. <br>
and started converting traffic from google blogs and youtube <br>
(more from youtube, as i remember it) to my links. <br>
used to post random videos, from game-crack-help whatnot on yt <br>
these links showed ads while visitors accessed them. <br>
i was used proxies to bypass the system (high-quality proxies worked, <br>
but my account usually got banned). <br>
it’s crazy to think that a kid was playing with 1’s, 2’s, <br>
and a couple of dots to find ways to bypass the system. <br>
i used to browse hacker forums for proxy tools to game the system. <br>
back then doing what im doing was <b>(infinite money glitch.)</b> <br>

but i wasn’t able to withdraw the money since i didn’t have a bank account. <br>
later, that platform had ~$20 to withdraw <br>
<b>(that was my first-ever crazy internet money).</b> WOW<br>
the worst part is i can’t recall the link-shortening provider name <br>
link-something something, it had a dark green logo as i recall it<br> 
it’s been almost 10 years since then. <br>
i remember them sending me a random email on a random day, <br>
asking me to withdraw as i had a balance in it. <br>

later, when i came of age, the platform was no more. <br>
~$20 my first internet money, went the drain <br>
around that time, i also discovered e-commerce. <br>
there was a platform named wooplr (luckily, i remember the name this time), <br>
where you could create your own affiliate store for free. <br>
just had to add products from other stores with your margin. <br>
i didn’t know much about marketing back then, <br>
so i used to text people in random stranger chats to promote my products in disguise. <br>
that wasn’t much of a success, and the platform eventually shut down. <br>

when i got into high school, i got myself a minor pan card <br>
(since i wasn’t 18 yet) and a bank account from the bank near my school. <br>
i got started with amazon affiliate marketing. <br>
as the tech head in my circle, i referred all my friends to gaming laptops. <br>
earnings in those days were good — ~$50 per affiliate. <br>
around that time, i also discovered crypto. <br>
i tried mining on my potato pc (sadly, i didn’t mine doge). <br>
also did many small gigs in between, including falling for scams like multi-level marketing. <br>

around that time, i got interested in cybersecurity <br>
<b>(yes, someone who’s always chasing new interests — that’s the generalist in me).</b> <br>
i joined a hacker academy to learn more. <br>
my parents thought hacking was bad for kids, but i insisted that's what i want to become.<br>
i did lots of mischief with hacking. more the script kiddie.<br>
self learned python, building instagram bots, and bruting the student login was all part time fun <br>

fast forward fast forward, i am of of age 18, <br>
joined a college, i rediscovered crypto, won my first-ever hackathon. <br>
discovering hackathons was a lightbulb moment for me. <br>
kinda went on a hackathon streak, winning almost 15+ hackathons till date. <br>
the covid hit, gave lots of time to learn from home. <br>
earned through airdrops, grants, trading, and web3. <br>
it was like "internet black box money" — meme coins and yield on crypto. <br>
might have earned couple of thousand dollars $ there. <br>

fast forward again, i skipped campus placement offers and started (cofount.com) with friends. <br>
there’s still a lot more to earn and grow. <br>
