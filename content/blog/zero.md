everything started with an experiment when i was 15.

back then, i was all-in on video games. i didn't own a game boy—though having one was the dream—but i had something better: an emulator on my pc and an insatiable curiosity. pokémon red, blue, firered, ruby, emerald—i played them all, cracked them all.

i wanted to learn reverse engineering just so i could crack any game i wanted. x64dbg and decompilers became my playground. the day i successfully cracked winrar? pure euphoria. while today's kids that age are building million-dollar startups from their bedrooms, i was playing with 1's, 0's, and a couple of dots, trying to outsmart systems that weren't meant to be outsmarted.

## the stupid and foolish days

somewhere around that time, i discovered link-shortening platforms. the concept was simple: convert traffic into ad views, ad views into money. i started posting random videos on youtube—game tutorials, crack guides, whatever worked—and funneling viewers through my shortened links on linkshrink.

the system had rules. i used proxies to bypass them. high-quality proxies worked better, but my accounts usually got banned anyway. i'd browse hacker forums late into the night, hunting for new proxy tools. to me, this was the infinite money glitch.

but there was one problem: i was 15. no bank account meant no withdrawals.

linkshrink—with its dark green logo that i can still picture—eventually sent me an email years later. i had around $20 waiting for withdrawal. by the time i came of age and could actually claim it, the platform had shut down.

twenty dollars. my first internet money. gone.

## the e-commerce detour

around the same time, i discovered a platform called wooplr where you could create your own affiliate store for free. just add products from other stores with your markup. simple.

marketing, however, was not simple. i didn't know anything about it, so i did what any resourceful teenager would do: i texted random strangers in chat rooms, pretending to casually mention my products.

it didn't work. wooplr eventually shut down too.

## getting legitimate

high school brought my first real wins. i got myself a minor pan card (since i wasn't 18 yet) and opened a bank account near my school.

armed with actual financial infrastructure, i dove into amazon affiliate marketing. being the tech guy in my circle paid off—i referred all my friends to gaming laptops. back then, the commissions were generous: ~$50 per affiliate sale.

i also discovered crypto around this time. i tried mining on my potato pc (sadly, i didn't save my dogecoin private keys). between affiliate marketing and crypto experiments, i was doing every small gig i could find—including falling for multi-level marketing scams that promised the world and delivered nothing.

## the hacker phase

my interest shifted to cybersecurity. i joined a hacker academy despite my parents' concerns that "hacking was bad for kids." i insisted this was what i wanted to become.

i started as a script kiddie, but i grew from there. i taught myself python, built instagram bots, wrote my own tools, and spent way too much time trying to brute-force the student login portal. it was all part-time fun, but it taught me how systems actually worked—and how they broke.

## the turning point

at 18, i joined college and rediscovered crypto with fresh eyes. then i won my first hackathon.

that was the lightbulb moment. hackathons became my nobrainer. i went on a winning streak—15+ hackathons to date. each one taught me something new: how to build fast, how to pitch better, how to work with strangers and ship products in 48 hours.

then covid hit.

while the world locked down, i had time to learn from home. i earned through crypto airdrops, grants, trading, web3 projects. it felt like discovering "internet black box money"—meme coins, yield farming, protocols that didn't exist six months prior. i probably made a couple thousand dollars during that period, though honestly, the learning was worth more than the money.

## today

i skipped campus placement offers. instead, my friends and i started cofount.com.

there's still a lot more to earn and grow. but looking back at that $20 i never withdrew from linkshrink—the journey from there to here taught me something more valuable than any payout:

the internet rewards curiosity, persistence, and the willingness to try things that might not work. sometimes they don't. sometimes the platform shuts down before you can cash out.

but sometimes, you build something that matters.
