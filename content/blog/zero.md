everything started with an experiment when i was 15. <br>

back then, i was all-in on video games. <br>
i didn't own a game boy—though having one was the dream—but i had something better: <br>
an emulator on my pc and an insatiable curiosity. <br>
pokémon red, blue, firered, ruby, emerald—i played them all, cracked them all. <br>

i wanted to learn reverse engineering just so i could crack any game i wanted. <br>
x64dbg and decompilers became my playground. <br>
the day i successfully cracked winrar? pure euphoria. <br>
while today's kids that age are building million-dollar startups from their bedrooms, <br>
i was playing with 1's, 0's, and a couple of dots, trying to outsmart systems that weren't meant to be outsmarted. <br>

## the stupid and foolish days

somewhere around that time, i discovered link-shortening platforms. <br>
the concept was simple: convert traffic into ad views, ad views into money. <br>
i started posting random videos on youtube—game tutorials, crack guides, whatever worked— <br>
and funneling viewers through my shortened links on linkshrink. <br>

the system had rules. i used proxies to bypass them. <br>
high-quality proxies worked better, but my accounts usually got banned anyway. <br>
i'd browse hacker forums late into the night, hunting for new proxy tools. <br>
to me, this was the infinite money glitch. <br>

but there was one problem: i was 15. no bank account meant no withdrawals. <br>

linkshrink—with its dark green logo that i can still picture—eventually sent me an email years later. <br>
i had around $20 waiting for withdrawal. <br>
by the time i came of age and could actually claim it, the platform had shut down. <br>

twenty dollars. my first internet money. gone. <br>

## the e-commerce detour

around the same time, i discovered a platform called wooplr <br>
where you could create your own affiliate store for free. <br>
just add products from other stores with your markup. simple. <br>

marketing, however, was not simple. <br>
i didn't know anything about it, so i did what any resourceful teenager would do: <br>
i texted random strangers in chat rooms, pretending to casually mention my products. <br>

it didn't work. wooplr eventually shut down too. <br>

## getting legitimate

high school brought my first real wins. <br>
i got myself a minor pan card (since i wasn't 18 yet) and opened a bank account near my school. <br>

armed with actual financial infrastructure, i dove into amazon affiliate marketing. <br>
being the tech guy in my circle paid off—i referred all my friends to gaming laptops. <br>
back then, the commissions were generous: ~$50 per affiliate sale. <br>

i also discovered crypto around this time. <br>
i tried mining on my potato pc (sadly, i didn't save my dogecoin private keys). <br>
between affiliate marketing and crypto experiments, i was doing every small gig i could find— <br>
including falling for multi-level marketing scams that promised the world and delivered nothing. <br>

## the hacker phase

my interest shifted to cybersecurity. <br>
i joined a hacker academy despite my parents' concerns that "hacking was bad for kids." <br>
i insisted this was what i wanted to become. <br>

i started as a script kiddie, but i grew from there. <br>
i taught myself python, i remember building instagram bots that used to get me followers on my side quest experiments, wrote my own tools, <br>
and spent way too much time trying to brute-force the student login portal. <br>
it was all part-time fun, but it taught me how systems actually worked—and how they broke. <br>

## the turning point

at 18, i joined college and rediscovered crypto with fresh eyes. <br>
i got more serious in coding and programming, more entrepreneurial. <br>
i started a club in college where we went for hackathons and built products together. <br>

then i won my first hackathon. <br>

that was the lightbulb moment. hackathons became my nobrainer. <br>
in course of time, we won more than 15 hackathons. <br>
each one taught me something new: how to build fast, how to pitch better, <br>
how to work with strangers and ship products in 48 hours. <br>

then covid hit. <br>

while the world locked down, i had time to learn from home. <br>
i earned through crypto airdrops, grants, trading, web3 projects. <br>
it felt like discovering "internet black box money"—meme coins, yield farming, <br>
protocols that didn't exist six months prior. <br>
there was this time i found a loophole in brave browser's bat (basic attention token) distribution<br>
and discovered a way to get more than intended. <br>
i built a tool to automate the whole flow. <br>
didn't go super black hat, but that was definitely a gray hat thing i did. <br>
i probably made a couple thousand dollars during that period, <br>
though honestly, the learning was more cool than the money. <br>

## today

i skipped campus placement offers. <br>
instead, my friends and i started cofount.com. <br>

there's still a lot more to earn and grow. <br>
but looking back at that $20 i never withdrew from linkshrink— <br>
the journey from there to here taught me something more valuable than any payout: <br>

the internet rewards curiosity, persistence, and the willingness to try things that might not work. <br>
sometimes they don't. sometimes the platform shuts down before you can cash out. <br>

but sometimes, you build something that matters. <br>
