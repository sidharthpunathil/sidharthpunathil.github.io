    <p>the house was dark except for my screen. it was 2am, maybe 3. i was 15, glued to x64dbg, staring at a wall of hex values i barely understood. somewhere in that mess of bytes was the thing that made winrar ask you to pay. i just had to find it.</p>
<p>i'd been at this for days. not because anyone told me to. not for school, not for a grade. i wanted to crack winrar because i wanted to know if i <em>could</em>.</p>
<p>the moment it worked — when the nag screen just... didn't appear — i didn't move. i sat there, staring at the screen, waiting for it to come back. it didn't. i closed the program. opened it again. nothing. the satisfaction was unreal. i never told a soul. all my victories were private.</p>
<p>today, 15-year-olds are printing millions from their bedrooms. age was never the barrier.</p>
<p>it reinforced something i was starting to believe. you can get whatever you want if you're stubborn enough to bend it your way.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-started">how it started</h2>
<p>i never owned a game boy. i wanted one so bad, but we didn't have that kind of money for toys. what i did have was a pc and an emulator i found from the internet.</p>
<p>pokémon, prince of persia, grand theft auto, claw — i played through everything i could find. all i had time for was games.</p>
<p>that's how i figured out — if i learned reverse engineering, i could crack and play any game i wanted.</p>
<h2 id="the-i-never-got">the $ i never got</h2>
<p>somewhere around that time, i discovered link-shortening platforms. the idea was simple: you wrap a link in ads, share it everywhere, and get paid per click. linkshrink. dark green logo. i can still picture it.</p>
<p>i started posting game tutorials on youtube — how to crack this, how to mod that — and every link in the description went through linkshrink. i'd check my dashboard obsessively. $0.30. $0.87. $1.14. watching those numbers tick up felt like discovering a cheat code for real life.</p>
<p>then i found out about proxies.</p>
<p>if you could fake traffic from high-value countries, the payout per click went up. so i did. i'd browse hacker forums, hunting for proxy lists, rotating IPs, trying to stay one step ahead of the ban hammer. most of my accounts got nuked. i'd just make new ones.</p>
<p>to a 15-year-old, this was the infinite money glitch. i was going to be rich.</p>
<p>except for one problem: i didn't have a bank account. you can't withdraw money from the internet if you don't have a place to put it. so i watched my balance climb and figured i'd cash out eventually. no rush.</p>
<p>years later, an email showed up. linkshrink was shutting down. withdraw your balance now.</p>
<p>i still didn't have a bank account.</p>
<p>by the time i finally opened one, the platform was gone. the website, the dashboard, the dark green logo — all of it. my first internet money. vanished before i ever touched it.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-things-to-understand-them">breaking things to understand them</h2>
<p>after that, something shifted. i was getting more interested and invested in the world of programming. i picked up python, and automating things felt like magic — it was my favourite thing to do.</p>
<p>i joined a hacker academy. my parents thought &quot;hacking&quot; meant i was going to end up in jail. i told them this was what i wanted to do with my life. they weren't convinced, but they let me go.</p>
<p>i started by running tools built by faceless accounts with god-tier pfp on hacker forums — tools i didn't fully understand, against targets i probably shouldn't have been touching. but i kept going. the first bot i actually built was an instagram bot, and many followed. after that, i couldn't stop building. looking back, i should have shared more of it.</p>
<p>i spent nights inside forums where people shared things you couldn't find on google. not because it was secret, but because no one outside those circles cared enough to look.</p>
<p>my username on cracked.to was borrowed from a video game character. it started gaining traction after i shared something the users considered high value. the platform gave me a rank — suddenly i had access to every resource on there. i'd lurk like a ghost, never reacting, never interacting, just quietly taking what i needed. that was a crazy feeling.</p>
<p>according to my friend, the most useful program i ever wrote was a brute-force script to pull details of his crush from the administrative portal.</p>
<p>every system i broke taught me how to build a better one.</p>
<h2 id="the-moment-it-clicked">the moment it clicked</h2>
<p>i was 18, joined college. discovered hackathons randomly on the internet — i'd always been good at finding stuff online, maybe that's what clicked. walked into my first one with zero expectations. forty-eight hours later, we won.</p>
<p>i remember the exact feeling — not the prize, not the announcement — but the moment during the build when everything was falling into place. the code was working, the pitch was sharp, and for the first time, the thing i'd been doing alone in my room for years suddenly mattered to other people. this was before ai could do it all for you — every line was handwritten, and all those late nights were finally paying off.</p>
<p>after that, we couldn't stop. our team started to attend more, and we kept winning.</p>
<p>each one compressed months of learning into a single weekend. how to ship fast. how to pitch under pressure. how to build with strangers and trust the process.</p>
<p>then covid locked the world down, and i had nothing but time.</p>
<p>somewhere in there, i rediscovered crypto — last time was high school, but this time i went all in. airdrops, grants, meme coins, yield farming, internet black box money — protocols appearing overnight and disappearing just as fast.</p>
<p>i found a loophole in brave browser's token distribution and built a tool to automate it. it wasn't a critical issue — just something you could automate at scale. gray hat? probably. i never shared it online. but me and my friends made a couple thousand dollars and learned more about bending the rules — which was what always gave me a kick.</p>
<h2 id="the-bet">the bet</h2>
<p>when campus placements came around, i got a couple of offers but was never actively invested in the job search.</p>
<p>the boys from high school — adithya and rajat. we'd catch up every time i was home. one of those conversations refused to end. that became <a href="https://cofount.com">cofount</a>.</p>
<p>if there's one thing all of this taught me — the internet doesn't care about your age, your background, or your bank account. it only cares if you show up.</p>
<p>i'm still showing up.</p>
